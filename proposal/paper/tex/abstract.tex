\begin{abstract}
  In the interest of development agility and functionality
  decomposition, many large scale, edge, and IoT services are 
  developed as the combination of a collection of network
  communicating processes, so called \mservices{}.
  %
  These \mservices{} can be programmed in different languages, deployed
  independently, and have varying degrees of security requirements.
  %
  While this approach greatly simplifies the deployment and life-cycle
  of large scale networked applications, it hampers security and
  safety analysis and it makes end-to-end arguments hard to establish.
  
  To tackle these problems we propose \armour{}, a language-based
  approach secure applications developed under the \mservice{} umbrella.
  %
  \armour{} implements a programming language to describe security
  policies at the level of the API of \mservices{}.
  %
  The runtime of \armour{} is implemented as a security monitor,
  whereby each \mservice{} cooperates with an \armour{} proxy charged
  with executing \armour{} policies.
  
  In this paper we present the high-level design of \armour{}, its
  data-plane IR language, and its implementation.
  %
  We present a number of example policies and a simple evaluation of
  our working prototype.
