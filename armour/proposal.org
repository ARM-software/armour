* Present a Scenario
1. Single Trusted Application
   - Single organization developing the application
   - Single application
   - Many containers/nodes belonging to a single application
   - Trust
     -- Policy: Centralized
     -- Application: Trusted
     -- Infrastructure: Trusted
2. Trusted Multi-tenancy
   - Multiple organizations that might trust each other
   - Multiple applications
   - Many containers/nodes belonging to different applications
   - Trust
     -- Policy: Centralized
     -- Applications: Trusted
     -- Infrastructure: Trusted
3. Untrusted multi-tenancy
   - Multiple applications that do not trust each other
   - Multiple applications
   - Many containers/nodes belonging to different untrusted applications
   - Trust
     -- Policy: Centralized / Multiple-owners
     -- Applications: Untrusted
     -- Infrastructure: Trusted
4. Untrusted multi-tenancy in adversarial infrastructure
   - Multiple organizations that do not trust each other
   - The Policy execution mechanism is not necessarily trusted
   - Many applications
   - Many containers/nodes not trusted
   - The infrastructure provider is not trusted
   - Trust
     -- Policy: De-Centralized / Multiple-owners
     -- Applications: Untrusted
     -- Infrastructure: Untrusted
     -- Policy:
        -- Untrusted because the infrastructure is untrusted
        -- Each party trusts its policy, not other parties policies
* Questions: 
** Policy ownership
** Cooperation between parties
** Data-centric policies
